## Frontend build

### Prerequisites
- **NPM**:Required for installing additional packages and running scripts.
- **Node.js**: Needed for configuration and running npm.
- Create .env file by doing: `cp env-template .env`. Set all the necessary values inside it (If you already have one, just set the values)


### How to run a build
To start the project you need to download and install node.js and npm. Use the following link:
- [Node.js & NPM](https://trello.com/b/oDkMzePx/deputy-on-track)

After setting up **Node.js** check versions executing next commands:

### For checking Node.j version
```bash
node -v
```

### For checking NPM version
```bash
npm -v
```

If both commands succeeded then install all necessary packages including vite to run a build
### For installing node_modules
```bash
npm i
```
If you are in root directory, move to **/frontend** directory with following command:
```bash
cd frontend
```

### For running a build
```bash
npm run dev
```
### Access in the browser
You can access the server via the following link, provided it's run on localhost: http://localhost:<VITE_FRONTEND_PORT>. Note: VITE_FRONTEND_PORT is taken from .env file.




## Conventions
Keywords denoting types of your changes (commits, pull-requests, branches):
- `feat` - a new feature: Adding something new that users or other parts of the system can interact with.
Example of commit message: 'feat: add check-in endpoint'
- `fix` - a bug fix: Resolves an issue or unintended behavior.

- `chore` - non-functional task: updating build scripts, configs, or dependencies. No user-facing impact.
Example of commit message: 'chore: update Makefile with new flags'
- `docs` - documentation only changes. Use the docs prefix when the commit only updates documentation, like README, code comments, API docs etc.
Example of commit message: 'docs: add installation steps to README'
- `test` - adding or modifying tests: Use the test prefix when adding new tests, updating existing ones, or making changes related to testing.
Example: test: add unit tests for check-in endpoint.
- `revert` - reverting the pull request.

Note: prefix the names of your commits, pull-request, branches with the mentioned keywords to specify the type of your changes.
